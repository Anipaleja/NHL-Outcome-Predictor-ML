A machine learning system that predicts NHL game outcomes using advanced AI architectures. Built with transformer neural networks, quantum-inspired ensembles, and comprehensive feature engineering for professional-grade accuracy.

## Features

- **Transformer Neural Networks**: Multi-head attention mechanisms for complex pattern recognition
- **Quantum-Inspired Ensembles**: Advanced ensemble methods with LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost
- **261 Advanced Features**: Comprehensive feature engineering from team statistics to venue analysis
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive UI for team vs team predictions
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live NHL API integration with intelligent caching
- **Venue Intelligence**: Home/away advantages and playoff mode considerations

## Technical Architecture

This system employs a sophisticated multi-layer approach:

- **Core ML Framework**: PyTorch transformers with 512-dimensional embeddings and 16 attention heads
- **Ensemble Pipeline**: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost with intelligent weight optimization
- **Feature Engineering**: 43 â†’ 261 features including rolling averages, momentum indicators, and venue analytics
- **Data Pipeline**: Robust NHL API integration with CSV fallback (62,890+ historical games)
- **Web Framework**: Flask-based interactive interface with real-time predictions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Quick Demo
```bash
python quick_demo.py
```

### 3. Launch Web Interface
```bash
python web_interface.py
```
Then open: http://localhost:5000
